  <p id="bio">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Zachary Blue and this is the first official website that I've have coded. I've been interested in coding for quite a while now but never took the necessary steps to pursue my interest. I enrolled into the Digital Media Academy camp aspiring to learn the basics in the field of the future, coding.</p>
